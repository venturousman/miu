The equals method compares name, salary, and visited. 
This means two Employee instances are considered equal if all three fields are the same.

The hashCode method includes the visited field in its calculation. 
This means that if the visited field changes, the hash code of the object will be changed as well.

The issue is the hashCode method in Employee class uses the visited field, which is mutable


Solution: 
Remove the visited field from both equals and hashCode methods.
