The Employee class has overridden the 'equals' function. As a result, the listsAreEqual function will run correctly.

The HashMap in Java does call the hashCode() method of an object when performing operations like put, get, and containsKey. 
In the removeDuplicates function, the containsKey operation is called/used
Because the Employee doesn't have/override the hashCode function, 
the containsKey operation will use the default hashCode method of Object class which returns an integer that is typically derived from the memory address of the object.
This default implementation is not suitable for employees used as keys in HashMap.
