Reason: 
The Employee class doesn't override the 'equals' function.
Because the existing 'equals' function in the Employee class doesn't have the correct prototype. 
It should be public boolean equals(Object obj) { ... }

The 'equals' function calling in the inList function, is using the equals function in Employee class. The result here is correct.
But the 'contains' function calling in the listsAreEqual function, is using the equals function in Object class. The result here is not correct.

Solution:
We need to override the equals function in the Employee class with the correct prototype/signature.
